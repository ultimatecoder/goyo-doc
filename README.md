## FAQ

### Why to install new plugin just for vim helpfile?

The main problem with Goyo plugin is that it carries very weak vim specific
helpfile. A vimmer is habituated to find help at vim specific helpfile first.
After few attempts I have decided to write a good helpfile for the [Goyo][goyo]
plugin. Reading description of this Github
[issue](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim/issues/144) will justify this step.
